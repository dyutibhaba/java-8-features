# java-8-features
lamda expression, stream api, date api, functional programming


#Why Java8
To support functional programming lamdas introduced and to support parallel programming & to resolve concurrency complexity
streams introduced.

#Functional Programming
.Embraces creating immutable objects bcoz FP discourages mutability
.More concise and readable code
.Using functions/methods as first class objects meaning the functions can be used as objects/variables to pass it 
in any method parameters.
e.g., Function<String, String> addSomeString = (name) -> name.toUpperCase().concat("default");
now addSomeString can be used as a variable.
.Writing code using Declarative approach rather an Imperative way.
 
#Imperative style of programming
.Focuses on how to perform the operations.
.Embraces object mutability.



#Declarative

# Lambda Expression
It's new feature introduced in Java8
